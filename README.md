# Benchmarking-using-MATLAB

As computer architecture has been developed, it is still very difficult to compare the performance of different 
computer systems simply by comparing their specifications. For this, few tests were developed and this allows 
comparison between different computer architectures.

In computing, benchmark is used to assess the relative performance of an object by running few test programming cases. 
Benchmarking is usually associated with assessing performance characteristics of computer hardware. Since benchmarking 
contains performance sensitive aspects, we can use this clues to improve performance. Thus, benchmarking is necessary 
for evaluating and comparing difference features or configurations of computer architectures.

In this project, we have focused on performing detailed benchmarking and analysis of the performance bottlenecks for 
these programs on two machines. Specifically, we have observed by profiling performances with 4 test cases using 
MATLAB: single thread simple for-loop, single thread for-loop with pre-allocated memory, implicit multi-thread, and 
explicit multi-thread examples.
